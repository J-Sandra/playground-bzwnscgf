# Introduction

Python is a high-level programming language that is dynamically typed and interpreted. Python has some similarities to the English language and its syntax allow to write a programs with fewer lines

## Syntax
After installing python, we create a python file by using the .py file extension
### Indentation
Indentation is very important because it indicates a block of code. It's a space at the beginning of a code line. If you ignore the indentation, Python give you a syntax error
For example,

```python runnable
for i in range (5):
    print('Hello World!')
```

# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced Python template](https://tech.io/select-repo/429)
