# Introduction

Python is a high-level programming language that is dynamically typed and interpreted. Python has some similarities to the English language and its syntax allow to write a programs with fewer lines

## Syntax
After installing python, we create a python file by using the .py file extension
### Indentation
Indentation is very important because it indicates a block of code. It's a space at the beginning of a code line. If you ignore the indentation, Python give you a syntax error
For example,

```python runnable
for i in range (5):
print('Hello World!')
```

```python runnable
for i in range (5):
    print('Hello World!')
```
### Variables
A variable can contain values like integer,string,... and it's created the first moment you assing it the value
```python runnable
i = 5.456
m = "hey"
```
If you want to specify the data type or cast a variable, you can do casting, for example
```python runnable
i = int(i)
```
# Advanced usage
